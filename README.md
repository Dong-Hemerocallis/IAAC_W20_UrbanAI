# Welcome to the code repository for the ACADIA2020_DeepDesign workshop.
On this page you can find code that will allow you to explore 2D neural style transfer and 2D-3D neural style transfer. These editing techniques must be run on graphics processing units (GPUs) in order to run or train efficiently and in a reasonable time frame. Thus, this repository is designed to run on Paperspace, which is a cloud computing platform that allows you to access GPUs.
